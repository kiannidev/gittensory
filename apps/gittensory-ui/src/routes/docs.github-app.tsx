      <p>
        The hosted deployment uses the GitHub App slug <code>gittensory</code>. Start from{" "}

          the GitHub App install flow
        </a>
        , then choose only the repositories you want Gittensory to see.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Open the install flow and pick the owning account.</li>
        <li>
          Choose selected repositories instead of all repositories unless you are onboarding an org.
        </li>
        <li>
          Approve <code>Metadata: read</code>, <code>Pull requests: read</code>, and{" "}
          <code>Issues: write</code>. Enable <code>Checks: write</code> when Context or Gate check
          runs are enabled.
        </li>
        <li>
          Keep webhook events enabled for <code>issues</code>, <code>issue_comment</code>,{" "}
          <code>pull_request</code>, and <code>repository</code>.

        <li>
          Leave <strong>Gittensory Context</strong> advisory while you tune copy and settings. Make{" "}
          <strong>Gittensory Gate</strong> required only after the repo explicitly enables blocking
          rules.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Default posture</h2>
      <p>
        Gittensory is advisory-first. Public comments, labels, the Context check, and the Gate check
        are controlled per repo. Missing issue links, non-Gittensor contributors, busy queues, and
        weak overlap signals do not block merge by default.
      </p>

      <h2>PR panel</h2>
      <p>
        The PR panel is one sticky bot comment that updates in place. It shows a public-safe
        readiness score, concrete signal evidence, and short actions for linked issues, related
        work, review load, validation evidence, open PR queue, contributor context, and Gate result.
      </p>

      <h2>Checks</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Gittensory Context</strong> is advisory and should not be required in branch
        protection. <strong>Gittensory Gate</strong> is opt-in and can be made required after a repo
        owner chooses blocking rules.
      </p>
      <p>
        Branch protection should require <strong>Gittensory Gate</strong> only after the repo has
        verified installation health, previewed the public panel, and configured at least one{" "}
        <code>block</code> rule. Do not require <strong>Gittensory Context</strong>; it is there to
        inform reviewers, not stop merges.
      </p>

      <h2>Gate modes</h2>
      <p>
        Each Gate rule supports <code>off</code>, <code>advisory</code>, or <code>block</code>.
        Linked issue, duplicate PR, and quality-score checks default to <code>advisory</code>. The
        quality rule only blocks when <code>qualityGateMode</code> is <code>block</code> and a
        <code>qualityGateMinScore</code> threshold is configured.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Configure as code (<code>.gittensory.yml</code>)
      </h2>
      <p>
        Every setting can be committed to <code>.gittensory.yml</code> at the repo root instead of,
        or layered over, the dashboard. Precedence is <code>.gittensory.yml</code> &gt; repository
        settings &gt; safe defaults; an unset field falls back to the next layer. It only chooses{" "}
        <em>what</em> Gittensory does — only confirmed Gittensor contributors are ever hard-blocked,
        regardless of config.
      </p>
      <CodeBlock
        lang="yaml"
        code={`# Repository settings as code — any dashboard toggle:
settings:
  gateCheckMode: enabled        # the Gate on/off
  checkRunMode: enabled         # the advisory Context check on/off
  commentMode: detected_contributors_only
  publicSurface: comment_only

# Friendly gate alias (wins over settings: for gate fields):
gate:
  enabled: true                 # Gate on/off
  linkedIssue: advisory         # block | advisory | off
  duplicates: block
  readiness: { mode: advisory, minScore: 60 }

# Public review-panel content:
review:
  footer: { text: "Reviewed by our bot." }   # custom lead — the Gittensor register link is always appended
  note: "Run npm test before requesting review."
  fields: { relatedWork: false }              # show/hide individual panel rows`}
      />
      <p>
        Maintainer-supplied footer and note text is dropped if it contains forbidden public language
        (reward, score, wallet, hotkey, payout, etc.); the Gittensor attribution and register link
        always remain on the footer.
      </p>

      <h2>Dogfood mode</h2>
      <p>
        For repos like <code>JSONbored/gittensory</code> and <code>awesome-claude</code>, enable PR
        comments, labels, Context, and Gate together to test the full product surface. If another
        maintainer agent can merge quickly, configure that agent to wait for{" "}
        <code>Gittensory Gate</code> before merge or close.
      </p>

      <h2>Install diagnostics</h2>
      <p>
        After installing, verify your install health from the API. The readiness endpoint separates
        service health from data quality.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the install route changes, check the deployed <code>GITHUB_APP_SLUG</code> before
        publishing setup copy. For the hosted app, the expected slug is <code>gittensory</code>.
      </p>
