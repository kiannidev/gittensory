        Treat the self-host stack like production infrastructure. Keep secrets out of images and

      <h2>What this section covers</h2>
      <p>
        Self-hosting is a major product path, not a single install command. The service can run as a
        quiet advisory reviewer, a private maintainer copilot, or a full review operator. The docs
        are split by operating concern so you can onboard gradually.

      <h2>How self-hosting fits with hosted docs</h2>
      <p>
        The hosted maintainer workflow still applies: review modes, gate settings, safety rules, and
        privacy boundaries are the same concepts. Self-hosting adds infrastructure choices,
        deployment secrets, private config, and local operating responsibility. Use{" "}

        running the service yourself.
