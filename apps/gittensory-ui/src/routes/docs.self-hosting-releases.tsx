      <h2>Upgrade flow</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Read release notes for env, migration, or behavior changes.</li>
        <li>Back up the database or confirm Litestream health.</li>
        <li>Pull the new image tag.</li>
        <li>Recreate the app container.</li>
        <li>
          Check <code>/ready</code>, logs, queue metrics, and one test PR.

      <h2>Custom images</h2>
      <p>
        Custom builds are useful for testing local changes or including subscription CLIs. They
        should not contain secrets.

      <CodeBlock
        lang="bash"

docker compose up -d gittensory`}

      <h2>Sentry source maps</h2>
      <Callout variant="note">
        Official releases align <code>GITTENSORY_VERSION</code>, Sentry release ids, and uploaded
        source maps. For custom images, leave <code>SENTRY_RELEASE</code> unset unless you uploaded
        source maps for that exact built bundle.
      </Callout>

      <h2>Rollback</h2>
      <p>
        Roll back by pinning the prior image tag and recreating the container. Database migrations
        can make rollback harder, so keep backups and read release notes before upgrading a live
        maintainer instance.
