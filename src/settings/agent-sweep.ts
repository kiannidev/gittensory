// The scheduled re-gate sweep (#777) recomputes the gate verdict for OPEN PRs that no webhook is refreshing —
// the verdict can drift silently when the world changes under a static PR (the base advances, a sibling
// duplicate merges, the focus manifest or settings change). These pure helpers decide WHICH PRs a sweep
// recomputes so the processor stays a thin orchestration shell.

// Rate-aware ceiling: never recompute more than this many PRs per repo per sweep, so a repo with a large
// open queue cannot blow the queue-message budget. The stalest are picked first.
//
// REST-budget sizing (#audit-rate-headroom): all managed repos share ONE GitHub App installation = ONE ~5000/hr
// REST bucket. Each fanned-out per-PR re-review costs ~9 REST GETs (1 resync `GET /pulls/{n}`, then required-
// contexts + CI aggregate in prReadyForReview, then required-contexts + merge-state + CI aggregate + files in
// auto-maintain). The sweep re-arms every ~2 min (≈30 ticks/hr) and fans out per repo, so the worst-case hourly
// sweep cost is `SWEEP_MAX_PRS × repos × 9 × 30`. At the old cap of 25 over 3 self-host repos that is ~200k/hr.
// A cap of 6 still consumed nearly the whole REST bucket across three active repos, so scheduled sweeps now run
// at a smaller source budget and also skip while prior regate work is queued. A cap of 3 bounds the raw worst case
// to `3 × 3 × 9 × 30 ≈ 2.4k/hr`, leaving budget for live webhooks, cache misses, and branch-protection reads.
export const SWEEP_MAX_PRS = 3;

// Issue-side wake budget (#3989 review): SWEEP_MAX_PRS (3) is sized for a sweep that RECURS every ~2 minutes,
// so its ceiling has to survive being multiplied by ~30 ticks/hr. This handler instead fires ONCE per issue
// label/assignment webhook, so a larger one-shot source budget is safe -- but it still must be bounded, or a
// popular/tracking issue linked from hundreds of PRs would enqueue hundreds of ~9-REST-GET re-gates from a
// single event. 25 reuses this file's own prior sweep ceiling (see SWEEP_MAX_PRS comment) as a one-shot budget:
// worst case ~25 x 9 = 225 REST calls, staggered by the same delaySeconds window the caller already uses.
export const ISSUE_WAKE_MAX_PRS = 25;

// Sibling-merge wake budget (#4005): companion to the merge-train gate -- when a PR MERGES, every OTHER open PR's
// verdict can be invalidated (a newly-conflicting base, a duplicate cluster missing its winner, a linked-issue cap
// that just freed up) with nothing proactively re-checking it until the next sweep tick. This handler fires ONCE
// per merge, same one-shot shape as ISSUE_WAKE_MAX_PRS, but a merge is a far MORE common trigger than an issue
// label/assignment change -- a busy repo can merge many PRs an hour, each firing this fan-out, so reusing
// ISSUE_WAKE_MAX_PRS's 25 would let repeated merges inside one rate-limit window compound in a way the rarer
// issue-wake trigger never does. 15 keeps each merge's worst case at 15 x 9 ≈ 135 REST calls (same ~9-REST-GET
// per-PR re-review cost as the other agent-regate-pr fan-outs), staggered by the same delaySeconds window.

// because the sweep is now LIGHT (re-gate + act, no AI) and runs every ~2 min — a just-approved PR must be
// re-evaluated within minutes so it MERGES once its approval registers (BLOCKED→CLEAN). One hour stranded
// approved PRs unmerged for up to an hour.

/**
 * Select the open PRs a single repo sweep should recompute: drop drafts and anything a webhook touched within
 * `freshnessWindowMs` of `now` (don't race an in-flight review), then take the `max` PRs the sweep has gone
 * longest WITHOUT re-gating — ordered by `lastRegatedAt` ascending, NOT GitHub's `updatedAt`.
 *
 * Why two different timestamps (#audit-sweep-converge): the review WRITE that bumps GitHub's `updatedAt` is
 * SUPPRESSED under dry-run / pause, so ordering the sweep by `updatedAt` pins the stalest PRs forever and it
 * never advances. The sweep instead stamps its own `lastRegatedAt` marker on every pass (a D1 write, never
 * suppressed), so a just-regated PR sorts freshest and the next pass covers the next-stalest — full coverage of
 * all open PRs in ceil(open/max) sweeps. GitHub's `updatedAt` is used ONLY for the freshness skip (a PR a
 * webhook is actively gating), never for the sort. Pure + deterministic: same inputs → same ordered batch.
 *
 * `orderMode` (#3815, default `"staleness"`): an opt-in `"oldest-first"` mode instead orders candidates by
 * `createdAt` ascending, for an operator who wants deterministic creation-order draining over the staleness
 * sort's own convergence property. Unlike `regateProgress` above, a PR's `createdAt` never changes, so
 * `oldest-first`'s sort key alone cannot advance past an already-dispatched PR — without something else, the
 * same oldest `max` PRs would recur every sweep forever.
 *
 * `oldest-first` therefore drains never-regated PRs before cycling already-regated ones: while any eligible
 * non-priority PR lacks `lastRegatedAt`, the candidate pool is narrowed to those never-regated PRs (plus any
 * priority repairs). That preserves deterministic creation-order backlog recovery and covers a large initial
 * backlog in ceil(open/max) sweeps. Once every eligible PR has been swept at least once, it falls back to the
 * staleness key so continued periodic re-gating keeps converging instead of pinning the oldest PRs forever.
 * Selection-time only: real-time webhook-driven review is not gated by this sort and can still process any PR
 * out of order at any moment.
