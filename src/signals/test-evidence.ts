// that as passing evidence and let a configured manifest test expectation silently disappear. Rather than
// enumerate ever more literal phrase templates (which a previous version of this function tried, and which
// still missed "Not tested" because its test-noun list didn't include the verb form "tested"), detect
// negation by PROXIMITY: a negation word within a few words of a test/validation stem, in either order,
// with a shared stem definition so the "is this a test/validation mention at all" question is answered
// exactly once. The filler between the negation word and the stem may not cross a clause/sentence boundary
// (a comma, period, exclamation mark, or question mark), so an unrelated "not" earlier in the body (e.g.
// "This is not a breaking change. Tested with npm run test:ci.") cannot suppress a later, unrelated
// affirmative note. A colon, semicolon, or dash is deliberately NOT a hard boundary here -- see
// LABEL_SEPARATOR_GAP below.

// gate is specifically trying to detect (#3304, round 3). Split on the same clause-boundary punctuation the
// proximity checks already treat as a hard stop -- colon/semicolon/dash are excluded here on purpose
// (#3304, round 4): they are typically a label separator glued directly onto the word on either side
// ("Tests: not run."), and splitting on them would sever the stem from its own negation before the
// proximity checks ever run, the same way the round-3 bug worked one level up. Require at least one
// clause to be an affirmative, non-negated mention -- so an earlier honest "no tests" disclosure can no
// longer suppress later evidence.
